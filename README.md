# Design Microservices Architecture with Patterns & Principles

We’re going to learn how to **Design Microservices Architecture with using Design Patterns, Principles and the Best Practices.** We will using the right architecture design patterns and techniques.

**UDEMY COURSE WITH DISCOUNTED - Step by Step Design of this Repository -> https://www.udemy.com/course/design-microservices-architecture-with-patterns-principles/?couponCode=JULY25**

By the end of the course, you will Learn how to **handle millions of request with designing system for high availability, high scalability, low latency, and resilience to network failures** on microservices distributed architectures.

See the overall picture of **implementations on microservices architecture** on real-world **e-commerce microservices** project;

This course is will be the journey of software architecture design with **step by step evolving architecture** monolithic to event driven microservices.
- Iterate Design Architecture from Monolithic to Microservices Architecture with Patterns & Best Practices
- A step-by-step process for software system design and evolve from monolithic to microservices following the patterns & principles

### Check Explanation of this Repository on Medium
* [Monolithic to Microservices Architecture with Patterns & Best Practices](https://medium.com/design-microservices-architecture-with-patterns/monolithic-to-microservices-architecture-with-patterns-best-practices-a768272797b2)

## Whats Including In This Repository
We will start the basics of software architecture with designing e-commerce monolithic architecture that handles low amount of requests.

After that step by step evolves the architecture with
* Monolithic Architecture
* Modular Monolith Architecture
* Microservices, Event Driven Microservices
* and lastly Serverless Architectures
with designing together that handle millions of requests.

We will discuss microservices architectures with all aspects,
* Microservices Decomposition
* Microservices Communications (Sync / Async Message-Based Communication, API Gws)
* Microservices Data Management (Databases / Query / Commands / Distributed Transactions)
* Microservices Distributed Caching
* Microservices Deployments with Containers and Orchestrators
with applying microservices design patterns and practices.

We are going to design with together and step by step with our drawing tool that we will use this designing architectures.
We will start with designing Monolithic Architecture. And you can see that we have **Functional and Non-functional requirements** that should cover our design and we have patterns and principles toolbox that we will learn and use these principles when evolving architectures.
You will find that we will add new requirements in order to **handle millions of request and learn new patterns and practices** that will use these principles when evolving architectures.
* 3-Tier Architecture
* Microservices Architectures
* Microservices Architectures API Gws
* Microservices Architectures API Gws — BFF
* Microservices Architecture — Service Aggregator / Registry Patterns
* Microservices Architecture — Message Broker
* Microservices Architecture — Database Sharding Cassandra
* Event-Driven Microservices Architecture
* Microservices Distributed Caching
* Microservices Containers and Orchestrators
* Microservices Resillience

We will see full of **patterns and principle toolbox** is loading with new patterns and apply them into current designs. We will see latest patterns that we use more than **30 patterns and practices** with implementing **High scalability, High availability and handle millions of request requirements**.
